University Project for Computer Labs 4 in C# and React

## So, what is this?
Web page where health profissionals and pacients can log in to schedule and manage medical consultations (at home). In this project we were challenged to use Microsoft tecnologies. ASP.NET was used for the backend, MySQL for the database and React-JS for the frontend with the tailwindcss framework.
