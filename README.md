# LI4
University Project for Computer Labs 4 in C# and React

## So, what is this?
Web page where health profissionals and patients can log in to schedule and manage medical consultations (at home). In this project we were challenged to use at least one Microsoft tecnology. C# was used for the backend, MySQL for the database and React-JS for the frontend with the tailwindcss framework.
